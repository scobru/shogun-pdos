# ⚡ Shogun NoBackend

A suite of **17 minimalist, serverless web tools** that live entirely in your URL. 
Zero backend, zero tracking, 100% local.

## ✨ Features

- **No Backend**: State is stored in `localStorage` and the URL hash (compressed). Share the URL, share the state.
- **Privacy First**: No data leaves your browser.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Automatic detection with a manual toggle.
- **Premium Design**: Glassmorphism, smooth animations, and responsive layouts.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Designed to work perfectly on phone and desktop.

## 🚀 How to use

1. **Open any HTML file** in your browser (e.g., `index.html` to see the dashboard).
2. **Use the tool** (write notes, create lists, split bills).
